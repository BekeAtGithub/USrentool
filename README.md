### What Extra Costs Do Canadians Pay?

1. **Tax Preparation** (~$1,500/year)
   - US tax return (Form 1040-NR)
   - Canadian cross-border tax prep
   - ITIN application (one-time)

2. **Currency Exchange** (~2% loss)
   - Bank fees on USD → CAD conversion
   - Exchange rate spreads
   - Applied to monthly rent collection

3. **FIRPTA Withholding** (15% of sale price)
   - Withheld at closing when you sell
   - File US tax return to get refund of overpayment
   - Not your final tax, just a withholding

### Pro Tips for Canadians
- File **Form W-8ECI** to avoid 30% withholding on rental income
- This lets you pay tax only on NET income (after expenses) at normal rates (15-25%)
- Claim **Foreign Tax Credit** on Canadian return to avoid double taxation
- Consider holding property in Canadian corporation for estate tax planning
